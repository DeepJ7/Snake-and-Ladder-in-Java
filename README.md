# Snake-and-Ladder-in-Java
This is a classic snake and ladder game between 2-4 Players. Player rolls a dice and based on the outcome, player goes ahead. The player who reaches 100th square first, wins the game. The game continues untill every player except the last one reaches 100th square on the board. If a player gets a 6 by rolling the dice, they gets additional chance to roll the dice again. There are biscuits and bigsticks in the game. If a player gets a biscuit, they can feed it to the next snake they encounter, so the snake will not bite him. And the bigsticks can be used to raise the ladders by one step(except for the last row: 91th-100th). To win the game, players must reach exactly the 100th square (If they are in 99th square, they must get exactly 1 by rolling the dice to win).
